This is my pet project.

For a year and a half I worked as an analyst for the Russian-speaking sector in the mobile dating app Livu. The work was remote and took 1-2 hours a day. The task was to analyze the content of streamers for the presence of prohibited information. This is a very monotonous task. In addition, it was necessary to send brief reports to the team leader every day. After some time, I began to think, how can I optimize my work? This is how I got to know Python and libraries Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy. 

In this repository you can see the result of my initiative work, I automated the process:

* data aggregation;
* drawing up plots; 
* sending reports via telegram bot.

From manual work, only the process of checking messages remained, where either a well-trained algorithm of the language model was needed (at that time the company did not have this, and I did not have the knowledge to write on my own), or a Russian-speaking person, which I acted as.

**Stack:**

* Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Datetime, Telebot, Os)
* Jupiter Notebook
